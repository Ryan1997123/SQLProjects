<h1>Calculating Churn Rates Project</h1><br>
Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks you to look into subscription churn rates. Itâ€™s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.
<br>
<br>
The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide you with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.
<br>
<br>
The dataset provided to you contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:
<br>
<br>

<strong>id</strong> - the subscription id<br>
<strong>subscription_start</strong> - the start date of the subscription<br>
<strong>subscription_end</strong>- the end date of the subscription<br>
<strong>segment</strong> - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to
Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.<br>
