<h1>Welp Project</h1><br>
<b>Project from Code Academy's Analyzing Data with SQL Course </b><br><br> 
To practice what I've learned about joining multiple tables, I will use data from an exciting app called Welp. 
<br>"Users love Welp because it allows them to leave reviews of businesses in their city and see how other people reviewed the businesses."
<br><br>
For this project, I worked with two tables:<br><br>

<b>places</b><br>
<b>reviews</b>
