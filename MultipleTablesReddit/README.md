<h1>Multiple Tables Reddit Lab</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>This project is from Codecademy's "Analyze Data with SQL Skill Path" Course</b>

For this project, I was working as a Data Analyst who was in charge of examining some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site.
<br>
<br>
On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate othersâ€™ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.
<br>
<br>
For the task I was given three tables:
<br>
<br>
<b>users</b>: users data<br>
<b>posts</b>: posts information<br>
<b>subreddits</b>: information about subreddits<br>
