<h1>The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.</h1><br><br>


In this project, I was working with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.
<br>
<br>
It has the following columns:<br>

id - the id of the art piece<br>
department - the department of the art piece<br>
category - the category of the art piece<br>
title - the title name of the art piece<br>
artist - the name of the artist<br>
date - the date(s) of the art piece<br>
medium - the medium of the art piece<br>
country - the country of the artist<br>
