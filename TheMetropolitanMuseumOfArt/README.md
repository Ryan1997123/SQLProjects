The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.<br>
In this project, I worked with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.
<br>
<br>
It has the following columns:<br>

<b>id</b> - the id of the art piece<br>
<b>department</b> - the department of the art piece<br>
<b>category</b> - the category of the art piece<br>
<b>title</b> - the title name of the art piece<br>
<b>artist</b> - the name of the artist<br>
<b>date</b> - the date(s) of the art piece<br>
<b>medium</b> - the medium of the art piece<br>
<b>country</b> - the country of the artist<br>
