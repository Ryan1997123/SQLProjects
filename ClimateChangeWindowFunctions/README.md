<h1>Practice with Windows Functions (Climate Change Project)</h1>

To practice what you’ve learned about window functions, you are going to use climate data from each state in the United States.
<br><br>A labeled map of the United States can be found here: <img src="USAMap.JPG" alt ="" height="400" width="400">

<br>
This data will show the average annual temperature for each state – this is the average temperature of every day in all parts of the state for that year.
<br>

For this project, you will be working with one table:

<strong>state_climate</strong>
